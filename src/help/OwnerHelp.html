JabRef can optionally mark all new entries added or imported to a database with your username.
You can disable or enable this feature by entering <b>Preferences -> General</b>, and you can also
change the name used to mark your entries. The default name used is your user name.

<p>The name will be added in a field called 'owner', which by default is visible in the <b>General fields</b>
  tab in the Entry Editor.
