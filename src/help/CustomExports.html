<H1>Custom export filters</H1>

JabRef allows you to define and use your own export filters, in the same way as the
standard export filters are defined. An export filter is defined by one or more
<i>layout files</i>, which with the help of a collection of built-in formatter
routines specify the format of the exported files. Your layout files must be prepared
in a text editor outside of JabRef.

<H2>Adding a custom export filter</H2>

The only requirement for a valid export filter is the existence of a file with
the extension <b>.layout</b>. To add a new custom export filter, open the
dialog box <b>Options -> Manage custom exports</b>, and click <b>Add new</b>.
A new dialog box will appear, allowing you to specify a name for the export filter
(which will appear in the <b>File -> Custom export</b> menu of the JabRef window),
the path to the <b>.layout</b> file, and the preferred file extension for the export
filter (which will be the suggested extension in the file dialog when you use the
export filter).

<H2>Creating the export filter</H2>

To see examples of how export filters are made, look for the package containing the layout files
for the standard export filters on our download page.

<H3>Layout files</H3>

Let us assume that we are creating an HTML export filter.

<P>While the export filter only needs to consist of a single <b>.layout</b> file, which in this case
could be called <i>html.layout</i>, you may also want to add two files called
<i>html.begin.layout</i> and <i>html.end.layout</i>. The former contains the header part
of the output, and the latter the footer part. JabRef will look for these two files whenever
the export filter is used, and if found, either of these will be copied verbatim to the output
before or after the individual entries are written.

<P>Note that these files must reside in the same directory as <i>html.layout</i>, and must be
named by inserting <b>.begin</b> and <b>.end</b>, respectively.

<P>In our example export filter, these could look like the following:

<p><i>html.begin.layout</i>:<br>
<code>&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
  &lt;BODY&gt; text="#275856"&gt;<br>
&lt;basefont size="4" color="#2F4958" face="arial"&gt;</code>

<p><i>html.end.layout</i>:<br>
<code>&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</code>

<P>The file <i>html.layout</i> provides the <i>default</i> template for exporting one single entry. If
you want to use different templates for different entry types, you can do this by adding entry-specific
<b>.layout</b> files. These must also reside in the same directory as the main layout file, and
are named by inserting <b>.entrytype</b> into the name of the main layout file. The entry type name
must be in all lowercase. In our example, we might want to add a template for book entries, and this
would go into the file <i>html.book.layout</i>. For a PhD thesis we would add the file
<i>html.phdthesis.layout</i>, and so on. These files are similar to the default layout file, except that
they will only be used for entries of the matching type. Note that the default file can easily be made
general enough to cover most entry types in most export filters.

<H3>The layout file format</H3>

Layout files are created using a simple markup format where commands are identified by a preceding
backslash. All text not identified as part of a command will be copied verbatim to the output file.

<H3>Field commands</H3>

<p>An arbitrary word preceded by a backslash, e.g. <code>\author</code>, <code>\editor</code>,
<code>\title</code> or <code>\year</code>, will be interpreted as a reference to the corresponding field,
which will be copied directly to the output.

<H3>Field formatters</H3>

<p>Often there will be a need for some preprocessing of the field contents before output. This is
  done using a <i>field formatter</i> - a java class containing a single method that manipulates the
  contents of a field.
<p>A formatter is used by inserting the <code>\format</code> command followed by the formatter name in
  square braces, and the field command in curly braces, e.g.:

  <p><code>\format[ToLowerCase]{\author}</code>

<p>You can also specify multiple formatters separated by commas. These will be called sequentially,
  from left to right, e.g.

  <p><code>\format[ToLowerCase,HTMLChars]{\author}</code>

<p>will cause the formatter <b>ToLowerCase</b> to be called first, and then <b>HTMLChars</b> will be
  called to format the result. You can list an arbitrary number of formatters in this way.

<p>The argument to the formatters, withing the curly braces, does not have to be a field command. Instead,
you can insert normal text, which will then be passed to the formatters instead of the contents of any field.
This can be useful for some fomatters, e.g. the CurrentDate formatter (described below).

<p>JabRef provides the following set of formatters, some of which depend on the others:
<ul>
<li><code>HTMLChars</code> : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {\^a} or {\"{o}})
  with their HTML representations.
<li><code>XMLChars</code> : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {\^a} or {\"{o}})
  with their XML representations.
<li><code>CreateDocBookAuthors</code> : formats the author field in DocBook style.
<li><code>CurrentDate</code> : outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the
    current date and time in the format "yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z" (date, time and time zone). By giving a
    different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g.
    <code>\format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd}</code> will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30.

<li><code>AuthorFirstFirst</code> : formats author/editor fields with the first names first.
<li><code>AuthorFirstFirstCommas</code> : formats author/editor fields with the first names first, and deliminated by commas.
<li><code>AuthorLastFirst</code> : formats author/editor fields with the last names first.
<li><code>AuthorLastFirstAbbreviator</code> : abbreviates first and middle names of all authors. This formatter requires AuthorLastFirst
to have been run earlier.
<li><code>AuthorAndsReplacer</code> : replaces "and" between names with ";", and "&" between the last two. 
<li><code>AuthorAndsCommaReplacer</code> : replaces "and" between names with ",", and "&" between the last two.
<li><code>FormatPagesForHTML</code> : replaces "--" with "-".
  <li><code>FormatPagesForXML</code> : replaces "--" with an XML en-dash.
<li><code>RemoveBrackets</code> : removes all curly brackets "{" or "}".
<li><code>RemoveLatexCommands</code> : removes LaTeX commands like <code>\em</code>, <code>\textbf</code>, etc. If
  used together with <code>HTMLChars</code> or <code>XMLChars</code>, this formatter should be called last.
<li><code>ToLowerCase</code> : turns all characters into lower case.
</ul>

<p>If none of the available formatters can do what you want to achieve, you can add your own by implementing
  the <code>net.sf.jabref.export.layout.LayoutFormatter</code> interface. If you insert your class
  into the <code>net.sf.jabref.export.layout.format</code> package, you can call the formatter by its
  class name only, like with the standard formatters. Otherwise, you must call the formatter by its fully
  qualified name (including package name). In any case, the formatter must be in your classpath when running
  JabRef.

<H3>Conditional output</H3>

Some static output might only make sense if a specific field is set. For instance, say we want to follow
the editor names with the text <code>(Ed.)</code>. This can be done with the following text:

<p><code>\format[HTMLChars,AuthorFirstFirst]{\editor} (Ed.)</code>

<p>However, if the <code>editor</code> field has not been set - it might not even make sense for the entry
  being exported - the <code>(Ed.)</code> would be left hanging. This can be prevented by instead using the
<code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> commands:

<p><code>\begin{editor}<br>\format[HTMLChars,AuthorFirstFirst]{\editor} (Ed.)
<br>\end{editor}</code>

<p>The <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> commands make sure the text in between is printed if and
only if the field referred in the curly braces is defined for the ently being exported.

<p><b>Note:</b> Use of the <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> commands is a key to creating
  layout files that work well with a variety of entry types.

<H3>Grouped output</H3>

If you wish to separate your entries into groups based on a certain field, use the grouped output commands.
Grouped output is very similar to conditional output, except that the text in between is printed only if the
field referred in the curly braces has changed value.

<p>For example, let's assume I wish to group by keyword.  Before exporting the file, make sure you have sorted
your entries based on keyword.  Now use the following commands to group by keyword:

<p><code>\begingroup{keywords}New Category: \format[HTMLChars]{\keywords}
<br>	\endgroup{keywords}</code>

<H2>Sharing your work</H2>

With external layout files, it's fairly simple to share custom export formats between users.
If you write an export filter for a format not supported by JabRef, or an improvement over an
existing one, we encourage you to post your work on our SourceForge.net page. The same goes for
formatter classes that you write. We'd be happy to distribute a collection of submitted
layout files, or to add to the selection of standard export filters and formatters.
