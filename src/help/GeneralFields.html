    <h1>Customizing general fields</h1>
    <p>
    You can add an arbitrary number of tabs to the entry editor. These will be present for all entry types.
    To customize these tabs, go to "Options -> Set up general fields".
    
    <p>
    You specify one tab on each line. The line should start with the name of the tab, followed by a colon (:),
    and the fields it should contain, separated by semicolons (;).
    
    <p>
    E.g.<BR><code>General:url;keywords;doi;pdf<BR>
        Abstract:abstract;annote</CODE>
    <P>which would give one tab named "General" containing the fields <em>url</em>, <em>keywords</em>, <em>doi</em> and <em>pdf</em>,
    and another tab named "Abstract" containing the fields <em>abstract</em> and <em>annote</em>.
