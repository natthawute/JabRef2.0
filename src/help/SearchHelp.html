<H1>Searching</H1>


There are three different search modes in JabRef.

<p>
<em>CTRL-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface. Pressing
<em>CTRL-F</em> several times toggles search mode. When searching
incrementally, pressing <em>CTRL-F</em> makes the program search for
the next occurence of the search string.
<p>
<em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface, and
selects incremental search. When searching incrementally,
<em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> also finds the next occurence of the search
string.

<H2>Incremental search</H2>

When searching incrementally, the program searches immediately each
time you press a letter. The status line informs you about the success
of the search. Pressing the search shortcut keys causes the program to
find the next occurence of the current search string. If no further
occurences can be found, the status line will notify you about
this. Repeating the search again causes the search to restart at the
top. The search order always follows the current sorting of your
database. To escape an incremental search, press ESC or click "Clear
search".

<H2>Normal</H2>

In a normal search, the program searches your database for all occurences of your
search string, once you press ENTER. All entries that don't match are hidden, leaving for display the matching entries only.
To stop displaying the search results, press ESC or click "Clear search".

<a name="advanced"><H2>Field specification, logical operators</H2>

In order to search specific fields only and/or include logical operators in the search expression, a special syntax is available in which these can be specified. E.g. to search for entries whose author is "Miller", enter (in any but incremental search mode):
<p>
author = miller
<p>
Both the field specification and the search term support regular expressions. If the search term contains spaces, enclose it in quotes. Do <i>not</i> use spaces in the field specification! E.g. to search for entries about image processing, type:
<p>
title|keywords = "image processing"
<p>
You can use "and", "or", "not", and braces as intuitively expected:
<p>
(author = miller or title|keywords = "image processing") and not author = brown
<p>
The "=" sign is actually a shorthand for "contains". Searching for an exact match is possible using "matches" or "==". Using "!=" tests if the search term is <i>not</i> contained in the field (equivalent to "not ... contains ..."). The selection of field types to search (required, optional, all) is always overruled by the field specification in the search expression. To search for entries of a certain type, a pseudo field called "entrytype" is available:
<p>
entrytype = thesis
<p>
This finds entries whose type (as displayed in the "Entrytype" column) contains the word "thesis" (which would be "phdthesis" and "mastersthesis"). Another pseudo field "bibtexkey" allows to search for citation keys, e.g.
<p>
bibtexkey = miller2005

<H2>Search settings</H2>

 The <em>Settings</em> button opens a menu that allows to toggle case sensitivity and use of regular expressions in the search, and whether search results should be selected in the table.
