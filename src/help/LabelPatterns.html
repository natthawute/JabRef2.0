<H1>Customizing the BibTeX key generator</H1>

In the 'Key pattern' tab in Preferences, one can set the fields used in auto
generation of BibTex labels. The pattern can be set for each of the standard entry
types.
<H2>Key patterns</H2>
The pattern can contain any text you wish, in addition to field
markers that indicate that a specific field of the entry should be
inserted at that position of the key. A field marker generally
consists of the field name enclosed in square braces,
e.g. <b>[volume]</b>. If the field is undefined in an entry at the
time of key generation, no text will be inserted by the field marker.
<P>
Several special field markers are offered, which extract only a specific part of a field. These are listed below. Feel free to suggest new special field markers.

<P>
Special field markers:
<ul>
<li><b>[<code>auth</code>]</b>: The last name of the first author<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authors</code>]</b>: The last name of all authors<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authorsN</code>]</b>: The last name of up to N authors. If there are more authors, "EtAl" is appended.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authIniN</code>]</b>: The beginning of each author's last name, using
no more than N characters.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters of the first author's last name,
          and the last name initials of the remaining authors.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the first author's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the Mth author's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>auth.auth.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of the first two authors, and ".ea" if there are more than two.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authshort</code>]</b>: The last name if one author is given; the first character of up to three authors' last names if more than one author is given. A plus character is added, if there are more than three authors.<BR>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> If there is no author (as in the case of an edited book), then all of the above <b><code>[auth...]</code></b> markers will use the editor(s) (if any) as a fallback. Thus, the editor(s) of a book with no author will be treated as the author(s) for label-generation purposes. If you do not want this behaviour, i.e. you require a marker which expands to nothing if there is no author, use  <b><code>pureauth</code></b> instead of <b><code>auth</code></b> in the above codes. For example, <b><code>[pureauth]</code></b>, or <b><code>[pureauthors3]</code></b>.
<ul>
<li><b>[<code>edtr</code>]</b>: The last name of the first editor<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrIniN</code>]</b>: The beginning of each editor's last name, using
no more than N characters<BR>
<li><b>[<code>editors</code>]</b>: The last name of all editors<BR>
<li><b>[<code>editorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters of the first editor's last name,
 	and the last name initials of the remaining editors.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the first editor's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the Mth editor's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtr.edtr.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of the first two editors, and ".ea" if there are more than two.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrshort</code>]</b>: The last name if one editor is given; the first character of up to three editors' last names if more than one editor is given. A plus character is added, if there are more than three editors.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>firstpage</code>]</b>: The number of the first page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[<code>lastpage</code>]</b>: The number of the last page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[<code>shorttitle</code>]</b>: The first 3 words of the title<BR>
<li><b>[<code>shortyear</code>]</b>: The last 2 digits of the publication year<BR>
<li><b>[<code>veryshorttitle</code>]</b>: The first word of the title,
discounting 'the', 'a', 'an'.<BR>
 </ul>

<P>
A field name (or one of the above pseudo-field names) may optionally
be followed by one or more modifiers. Modifiers are applied in the order they are
specified.
<ul>
    <li><b>:abbr</b>: Abbreviates the text produced by the field name or spcial field
        marker. Only the first character and subsequent characters following white space
        will be included. For example, <b>[journal:abbr]</b> would from the journal name
        "Journal of Fish Biology" produce "JoFB".<br>
    <li><b>:lower</b>: Forces the text inserted by the field marker to
        be in lowercase.  For example, <b>[auth:lower]</b> expands the last
        name of the first author in lowercase.<br>
</ul>


<P>
If you haven't defined a key pattern for a certain entry type, the <b>Default
key pattern</b> will be used. You can change the default pattern - its setting
is above the list of entry types in the <b>Key pattern</b> section of the <b>Preferences</b>
dialog.

<P>
The default key pattern is [auth][year], and this could produce
keys like e.g. <code>Yared1998</code> If the key is not unique in the
current database, it is made unique by adding one of the letters a-z
until a unique key is found. Thus, the labels might look like:
<blockquote> <code>Yared1998</code><BR> <code>Yared1998a</code><BR>
<code>Yared1998b</code> </blockquote>

<h2>Regular expression replace</h2>

    After the key pattern has been applied to produce a key, you can choose to have the
    key generator search for occurences of a specific regular expression, and replace
    it with a string. The regular expression and replacement string are entered in the
    text fields below the list of key patterns.

    If the replacement string is empty, matches of the regular expression will simply
    be removed from the generated key.
