button in the toolbar.</em>
<P>
<em>Strings</em> are the <em>bibtex</em> equivalent to constants in a
programming language.  Each string is defined with a unique
<em>name</em> and a <em>content</em>. Elsewhere in the database, the
name can be used to represent the content.

<P>
For instance, if many entries are from a journal with an abbreviation
that may be hard to remember, such as 'J. Theor. Biol.' (Journal of
Theroretical Biology), a string named JTB could be defined to
represent the journal's name. Instead of repeating the exact journal
name in each entry, the characters '#JTB#' (without quotes) are put into the
<em>journal</em> field of each, ensuring the journal name is written
identically each time.

<P>
A string reference can appear anywhere in any field, always by enclosing
the string's name in a pair of '#' characters. This syntax is specific for
JabRef, and differs slightly from the <em>bibtex</em> notation that
is produced when you save your database.

<P>
A string may in the same way be referred in the content of another
string, provided the referred string is defined <em>before</em> the
referring one.

<p>While the order of strings in your BibTeX file is important in some cases,
you don't have to worry about this when using JabRef. The strings will be displayed
in alphabetical order in the string editor, and stored in the same order, except when
a different ordering is required by BibTeX.
