<H1>Fetching Medline entries</H1>

JabRef can download citations from the Medline database.
To use this feature, choose <b>Tools -> Fetch Medline</b>, 
and the Medline interface will appear in the side pane.
<P>
There are two ways of specifying which entries to download:

<ol>
<li> Enter one or more Medline IDs (separated by comma/semicolon) in the
text field.
<li> Enter a set of names and/or words to search for. You can use the operators
<em>and</em> and <em>or</em> and parentheses to refine your search expression.
</ol>

In both cases, press <b>Enter</b> or the <b>Fetch</b> button. If you
use a text search, you will be prompted with the number of entries
found, and given a choice of how many to download.

<p>The entries fetched will be added to your currently active database.

<H2>Using a Proxy Server</H2>

If you need to use an http proxy server, pass the server name and
port number to java at runtime.  These environment settings are documented
at <p> http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/net/properties.html

<p><code>java -Dhttp.proxyHost="hostname" -Dhttp.proxyPort="portnumber"</code>
