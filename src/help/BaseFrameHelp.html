<H1>The JabRef main window</H1>

<em>Note:</em> most menu actions referred in the following have keyboard shortcuts,
and many are available from the toolbar. The keyboard shortcuts are found in the
pull-down menus.
<p>
This is the main window from where you work with your databases. Below
the menubar and the toolbar is a tabbed pane containing a panel for
each of your currently open databases. When you select one of these
panels, a table appears, listing all the database's entries, as well
as a configurable selection of their fields.
<ul>
<li>You decide which fields are shown in the table by checking the fields you want
to see in the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>Fields can be edited directly in the table, by simply clicking on a cell and
typing the contents
(this edition mode is possible only if "Allow editing in table cells"
is selected in <strong>Options --> Preferences --> General</strong>).
Double-click a cell to enter a more powerful edit mode.
You can navigate the table with the arrow keys.</li>
<li>The table is sorted according to a set of fields of your choosing.
The default sort order is set up in <strong>Preferences -> Entry table</strong>,
but to quickly change the order,
    click the header of a column to set it as the primary sort criterion, or
    reverse the sorting if it is already set. Another click will deselect the column
    as sorting criterion. Hold down <b>CONTROL</b> and click a column to add, reverse
    or remove it as a sub-criterion after the primary column. You can add an arbitrary
    number of sub-criteria.
<li>Adjust the width of each column by dragging the borders between
their headers.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog, toggle whether the table should be
resized to fit the window. Enable this to ensure visibility of the whole table,
and disable it to make room for displaying more information.</li>
<li>Color codes can be toggled in the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog, and
they help you visualize the completeness of your database by coloring cells as
follows:
  <ul>
  <li>A <font color="red">red</font> cell in the leftmost column denotes an
  incomplete entry.</li>
  <li>A <font color="#909000">yellow</font> cell in the leftmost column denotes an entry
  that doesn't define all required fields by itself, but that contains a
  cross-reference.</li>
  <li>A <font color="blue">blue</font> cell denotes a required field.</li>
  <li>A <font color="green">green</font> cell denotes an optional field.</li>
  <li>An uncolored cell denotes a field which is not used by the <em>bibtex</em>
  program for this type of entry. The field can still be edited in JabRef.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ul>

<H2>Adding a new entry</H2>
There are several ways to add a new entry. The <strong>New entry</strong> menu
action shows a dialog where you can choose the type of the entry from a list. To
bypass this dialog, there are also separate menu actions for each entry type, and
keyboard shortcuts for the most common types.
<P>When a new entry is added, by default an
<a href="EntryEditorHelp.html">editor dialog</a> for the entry will be
opened. This behaviour can be toggled in the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog.
<P><em>Note:</em> We strongly recommend learning the shortcuts for
the entry types you use most often, e.g. CTRL-SHIFT-A for adding an
<em>article</em> entry.

<H2>Editing an entry</H2> To open an <a
href="EntryEditorHelp.html">editor dialog</a> for an existing entry,
simply double-click in the leftmost column of the appropriate line, or
select the entry and press ENTER.
If "Allow editing in table cells" is not selected in the dialog window
<strong>Options --> Preferences --> General</strong>, a double-click anywhere
on the appropriate line will open the <a href="EntryEditorHelp.html">editor dialog</a>.


<H2>Referencing a <em>bibtex</em> string in a field</H2>
In JabRef you write the contents of all fields the same way as you
would in a text editor, with one exception: to reference a string,
enclose the name of the string in a set of # characters, e.g.:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'#jan# 1997',<BR>
which will be interpreted as the string named 'jan' followed by ' 1997'.
<P>See also: <a href="StringEditorHelp.html">string editor</a>.
