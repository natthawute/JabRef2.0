<H1>The entry editor</H1>

<em>Opened from main window by double-clicking on the leftmost column of an entry
(by double-clicking anywhere on the entry line if "Allow editing in table cells"
is not selected in <strong>Options --> Preferences --> General</strong>)
, or by pressing ENTER. The panel is closed by pressing ESC.</em>
<P>
In this panel you can specify all relevant information on a single entry.
The entry editor checks the type of your entry, and lists all the fields that
are required, and the ones that are optional, for referring the entry
with <em>bibtex</em>. In addition, there are several fields termed <em>General
fields</em>, that are common to all entry types.

<P>You can fully customize which fields should be regarded as required and optional for each
type of entry, and which fields appear in the General fields tab. See
<a href="CustomEntriesHelp.html">Customizing entry types</a> for more information about this.

<P>For information about how the fields should be filled out, see <a href="BibtexHelp.html">Bibtex help</a>.

<H2>The entry editor's panels</H2>

The entry editor contains five panels, <em>required fields</em>,
<em>optional fields</em>, <em>general fields</em>, <em>abstract</em> and <em>bibtex
source</em>, where <em>general fields</em> and <em>abstract</em> can be customized
(see <a href="GeneralFields.html">Customizing general fields</a> for details).
Inside the three first panels, TAB and SHIFT-TAB are used
to switch focus between the text fields.

<P>Switch panels by clicking on the tabs, or navigate to the panel to
the left or right using the following key combinations: CTRL-TAB or CTRL-PLUS
switch to the tab to the right, and CTRL-SHIFT-TAB or CTRL-MINUS switch to the
tab to the left. You can also switch to the next or previous entry by pressing
CTRL-SHIFT-DOWN or CTRL-SHIFT-UP, respectively, or by clicking the
appropriate toolbar button.

<P>The <em>bibtex source</em> panel shows how the entry will appear
when the database is saved in <em>bibtex</em> format.  If you wish,
you can edit the <em>bibtex</em> source directly in this panel. When
you move to a different panel, press CTRL-S or close the entry editor,
JabRef will try to parse the contents of the source panel. If there
are problems, you will be notified, and given the option to edit your
entry further, or to revert to the former contents.

If <strong>Show source by default</strong> is checked in the
<strong>General options</strong> tab of the
<strong>Preferences</strong> dialog, the source panel will be the one
shown each time you open the entry editor. If you prefer editing the
source rather than using the other four panels, you should check this
option.

<P><strong>Tip:</strong> If your database contains fields unknown to
JabRef, these will be visible in the source panel.

<P><strong>Tip:</strong> the <I>pdf</I> and <I>url</I> fields support Drag and Drop operations.
You can drop there an url from your browser. either a link to a pdf file
(that JabRef can download for you) or you can keep the link.

<H2>Field consistency checking</H2>
When the contents of a field is changed, JabRef checks if the new
contents are acceptable. For field types that are used by
<em>bibtex</em>, the contents are checked with respect to the use of
the '#' character. The hash symbol is <em>only</em> to be used in
pairs, wrapping the name of a <em>bibtex</em> string that is
referenced. Note that JabRef does not check if the referenced string
actually exists (this is not trivial, since the <em>bibtex</em> style
you use can define an arbitrary set of strings unknown to JabRef).
<P>
If the contents are not accepted, the field will turn red,
indicating an error. In this case the change will not be stored.

<!--<H2>Word/name autocompletion</H2>
The entry editor offers autocompletion of words. In the Preferences dialog
you can enable or disable autocompletion, and choose for which fields
autocompletion is active.
<P>With autocompletion, JabRef records all words that appear in
each of the chosen fields throughout your database. Whenever you write
the beginning of one of these words, it will be suggested visually. To
ignore the suggestion, simply write on. To accept the suggestion,
either press <em>ENTER</em> or use your arrow keys or other keys to
remove the selection box around the suggested characters.
<P><em>Note:</em> the words considered for suggestion are only the ones
appearing in the same field in entries of the same database as the one you
are editing. There are many ways to realise this kind of feature, and if you feel
it should have been implemented differently, we'd like to hear your suggestions!

<H2>Copy <em>bibtex</em> key</H2>
Pressing CTRL-K or the 'key' button causes the <em>bibtex</em> key for your entry
to be copied to the clipboard.
-->
<H2>Autogenerate <em>bibtex</em> key</H2>
Press CTRL-G or the 'gen key' button (the magic wand) to autogenerate a <em>bibtex</em> key for your entry
based on the contents of its required fields.
<p>
